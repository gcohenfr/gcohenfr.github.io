# Gabriela V. Cohen Freue

My research work is interdisciplinary merging components from mathematical statistics, genomics and medical sciences. In particular, I am interested in developing new statistical methods that are robust to outliers and feasible for the anlaysis of high-dimensional datasets usually encountered in genomics and protoemics studies. I am currently working on extensions of classical estimation approaches to address problems related to data science and the analysis of big data, e.g, sparsity, measurement errors, confounding factors, collinearity. I have published both methodological and applied work related with these areas of study. I collaborate in different interdisciplinary research projects, including proteomics in multiple sclerosis, proteomics in cardiovascular diseases, and â€“omics in asthmatic patients, among others.
