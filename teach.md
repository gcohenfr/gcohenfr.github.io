My main goal at teaching is that the students seek a deep understanding of new or relevant concepts, which I pursue by encouraging active learning and bringing to the classroom real world problems. It is important that students not only learn and review statistical concepts, but also grasp their relevance and need to solve meaningful problems.

## [STAT450](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=STAT&course=450): Case Studies in Statistics

Statistics undergraduate students taking this case studies capstone course analyze real data provided by a researcher from a different discipline. More information on cases eligibility is available [here](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/how-can-you-get-help-your-data). I've been teaching this course since 2013. The main learning objective of the course are: students to:

-	to critically appraise study designs and data
-	to identify appropriate choices of statistical methodologies and apply them to solve real problems
-	to develop skills of working with non-statisticians
-	to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with statisticians and non-statisticians
