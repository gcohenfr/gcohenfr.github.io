<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<br>
<p>I work in statistical problems that usually appear in the analysis of
  proteomics and genomics data. For example, in these applications, some
  variables may be measured with error, the number of features is much larger
  than the number of observations, the observations are not always independent,
  outliers are present in the data, among others. Some extensions of classical
  estimation approaches have been proposed to address some of these issues
  and others remain open problems for future research.

  I am interested to work on the following topics:
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Statistical Genomics with special focus in Proteomics</li>
    <li>Robust Estimation and Inference</li>
    <li>Linear Models with Endogeneity</li>
  </ul>

<p>About Me:</p>

<p>
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics at University of British Columbia (UBC).
I am also a Canada Research Chair
(<a href="http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=3457">CRC II</a>) in Statistics.

Before arriving at UBC, I did my postdoctoral fellowship with <a href="http://dags.stanford.edu/index.html">Daphne Koller</a> at Stanford University. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2011, working with <a href="http://www.morrislab.ca/">Quaid Morris</a>.
My PhD <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~saram/thesis-v15r-march.pdf">thesis</a> was on integrating large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets to predict gene function.
