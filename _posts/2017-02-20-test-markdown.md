*Organizers*: Adam Olshen, Gabriela Cohen Freue, Rafael Irizarry, and Ronglai Shen.

Coming up in Oaxaca, Mexico, November 4-9, 2018

High-throughput genomic experiments are a key component of precision medicine. Such experiments are expensive and time consuming. Effort and resources are wasted by poor experimental design, inadequate pre-processing, and sub-optimal analytical strategies. Addressing these problems is fundamental to realizing the promise of precision medicine. [More details](http://www.birs.ca/events/2018/5-day-workshops/18w5202)
